calibrtr is an app which collects magnetometer readings from a Puck.js,
and fits it to an ellipse, using the method of least squares. When
running the program, make sure to rotate the Puck.js in all directions
while the lights are blinking in order to get a good dataset. In order
to stop data collection, press the button on the Puck.js.
